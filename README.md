# gnome-rounded-corners

Adds rounded corners to every monitor in Gnome


## Credits

Based on https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1434/i-like-em-curvy/
What I did is adding a setting menu to adjust the corner radius.
The menu is heavily based on https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/277/impatience/
